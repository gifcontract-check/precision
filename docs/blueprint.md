## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Charcoal gray (#333333) for a sleek, modern look. Based on the request for 'noir et blanc' but favoring a softer overall look, we'll start with dark gray. The institute is described as 'haut de gamme' and beauty-related.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, minimalist feel. Based on the request for 'noir et blanc' but avoiding starkness in the background.
- Accent color: Soft beige (#E8E2D1) to add subtle warmth and highlight important elements. Beauty contexts often utilize shades of skin, makeup, and earth. Contrast to the background should be small but present.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font. The user requested something modern and readable, and Inter suits both of those.
- Use simple, elegant icons related to beauty and training, in charcoal gray.
- Structure the site in clearly separated sections: header, about, formations, avis, FAQ, and footer.
- Incorporate subtle animations like fade-in effects and smooth scrolling transitions for a high-end feel.
